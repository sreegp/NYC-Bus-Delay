Any column after column 17 was not labled and it was difficult to decipher what the fields in these columns represented. Hence, rows with additional fields were removed to reduce anomalies in the data."

Scheduled arrival time is the stipulated time that a particular bus is supposed to arrive at a bus stop based on the bus schedule.\n",

Importantly, it considers the possibility that a bus that was supposed to arrive before midnight (based on scheduled arrival time) arrives the next day, a few minutes after midnight (based on expected arrival time). Similarly, it also takes into account the possibility that a bus that was supposed to arrive a few minutes after midnight on the next day (based on scheduled arrival time), arrives early a few minutes before midnight on the previous day (based on expected arrival time). The above mentioned two scenarios are based on the assumption that the difference between expected arrival time and scheduled arrival time is no more than twelve hours. In other words, a bus can't be more than 12 hours late or 12 hours early. \n",
